You pull your sword out of its sheath and swing down upon the gray blob,
but miss and blunt your blade against the ground instead. The gray blob
hisses at you and squirts a shaft of poison toward your face, which you
narrowly avoid by leaping sideways.

You are fighting a gray blob. Your attack pattern is

1 [Slash] 2 [Stab] 3 [Parry]

You slash at the blob, and hit it with a sickening splash. Your sword is
damaged by the burning acid. The blob squirts a stream of its deadly acid
at you, but you manage to jump out of the way and it only nicks you
lightly on the arm. You leap forward and stab the blob clean through. The
blob shudders slightly, then stops moving.

You have slain the blob. You carefully wipe your sword and place it back
in its sheath.

... back to the mud
