MAGIC HELP
WIND MANA
Wind mana is a bright yellow in color, regardless of the plane it originates from. Those with incredibly fine tuned senses (even more so than is normally required to see mana in the first place), say that there are variations in the color, but most mages could care less about the individual nuances since all sorts of wind mana tend to have the same usefulness - as a means of targetting spells or in spells of transportation in addition to the obvious direct manipulation of weather and air. The four types of wind mana are north, east, south, and west.
