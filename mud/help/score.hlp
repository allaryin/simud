SCORE
Shows your current score -- hit points, stats, how well you are armoured,
how hungry and thirsty you are, status effects, etc. For information on
what any piece of your score means, try looking it up as its own help
topic -- for example, ~CCOMhelp hp~CHLP. This command may be abbreviated
~CCOMsc~CHLP.

Note to wizards: This command may be used with a parameter to view
others' scores.
