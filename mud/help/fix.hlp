GENERAL HELP
FIXING BROKEN EQUIPMENT
Eventually, it will be possible for players with the appropriate crafting
skills to make repairs to almost any item in the game - clothing, weapons,
furniture, armour, etc...

At the moment, however, repairing equipment is not possible through any
conventional means. It is probably easier to simply make replacements for
broken goods for the time being.
