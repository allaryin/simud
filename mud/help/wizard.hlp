PLAYER HELP
WIZARD
A "wizard" is a basically someone with access to a MUD's internals
-- the file system, the object functions, all the complex source code that
makes the game run. As such, they don't play the game so much as build and
maintain it. 

If you have questions, it's good to ask a wizard (just use ~CREFwho~CHLP) to
see if any are online to ~CREFchat~CHLP with).
