MAGIC HELP
FIRE MANA
Fire mana is a deep blood red in color and is useful when manipulating flame and heat. It also has limited uses in beneficial magic directed at living targets, but that sort of thing is better left to highly skilled magicians. The plane itself is a roiling mass of burning gasses with occasional pockets of molten stone or of slightly cooler areas.
