INVENTORY
Your inventory is defined as the stuff you are currently carrying. This
includes clothing, food, weapons, tools, money, and anything else that you
might have picked up. How much you can carry depends on your size and
strength, and can be seen in your ~CCOMscore~CHLP.

You can see your current inventory with the ~CCOMinven~CHLP command, or by
simply typing ~CCOMi~CHLP.

Inventory saves when you log out.
