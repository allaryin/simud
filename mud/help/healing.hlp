PLAYER HELP
HEALING
Walraven can be a dangerous place, and you can easily find yourself in dire
need of some healing. You regenerate HP over time (slightly faster if you're
sitting down). You can also cast the "heal" spell or ~CCOMpray to Example for
healing~CHLP. In the near future, you'll be able to craft healing potions.
