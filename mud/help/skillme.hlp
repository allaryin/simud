COMMANDS
SKILLME
When typed in, this command gives a player all the basic skills that (s)he 
needs to survive. However, if the player already has skills, then this command 
will do nothing, and call the player silly.

~CBRTNote:~CHLP If something goes wrong and the skillme command thinks that
you have abilities that somehow you have lost... you can always type
~CCOMskillme force~CHLP to try to beat it into submission.
