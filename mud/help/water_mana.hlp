MAGIC HELP
WATER MANA
The plane of water is coincidentally enough composed almost entirely of liquid water. There are areas where the water is frozen, and where solid material may be found, but they are very rare. Water mana is white and has its greatest use in healing spells, but may also be used in conjunction with high order spells that use other sorts of mana as it blends very well and has a good controlling sort of effect.
