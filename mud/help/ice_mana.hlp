MAGIC HELP
ICE MANA
The plane of ice is largely composed of various sorts of frozen matter with occasional pockets of empty space. The mana is visually quite similar to that from the plane of earth, with the greens and blues switched, ie it is a rather vibrant blue with some green tint to it. Ice mana is largely useful when manipulating the cold or countering fire effects. It also has medical uses, but as with those that are fire-related, it is still a developing art.
