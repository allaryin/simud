PLAYER HELP
AUTOEAT
You type ~CCOMautoeat <thing>~CHLP to turn on your autoeat, and
~CCOMautoeat off~CHLP to turn it off. Typing the command by
itself tells you what the current <thing> is. Whenever you get hungry, you
will automatically eat whatever it is you typed in, as long as you have
one. A good strategy would be to buy a few dozen of something, turn on
your autoeat, and then forget about eating for a while.
