MAGIC HELP
SPIRIT MANA
Also simply called the plane of pure mana (or even more simply 'mana'), the plane of spirit mana supposedly overlaps the plane of earth. Spirit mana is an incredibly pale yellow color that is quite possible to mistake for white. It is most useful for manipulating small things of incredible detail or when working with thought, emotion, and other 'intangibles'. Spirit mana is also very good at controlling other sorts of mana and is the sort that one would use when breaking an enchantment.
