EMPATHY

Empathy(EMP): Empathy is a measurement of how 'in-tune' you are with the world around you. When dealing with animals and nature, empathy plays a big part. It is also important in certain types of magic, especially clerical spells. A high empathy often also means that you have a higher capacity for absorbing mana into your body.
