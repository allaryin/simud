FIND WEAKNESS
The find weakness skill is a measurement of how good you are at hitting
your enemies where it counts. A high skill in finding weaknesses means
that whenever you get a chance to score a critical hit, it really is
critical.

There are also other cases where it might apply, but it's up to you to
discover them.
