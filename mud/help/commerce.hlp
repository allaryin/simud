PLAYER HELP
COMMERCE
Currently, the game's coded economic system is rather sparsely used and not
terribly useful. This will change in the future.

Eventually, player-governments will be allowed to mint their own currency,
with which their citizens will be able to purchase things.

Until then, we have silly little coins that aren't good for much of anything
except dealing with npc shopkeepers. It'll get better one of these days, I
promise.
