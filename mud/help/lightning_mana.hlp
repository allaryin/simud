MAGIC HELP
LIGHTNING MANA
Lightning mana is royal purple and has found little use outside of that as a weapon. The ban on its use by the guild has pretty much stunted all research on the subject, so little is known of the plane or its energy. Speculation exists that since so many other sorts of mana are useful in medicine that a lifting of the ban would proove that lightning mana too may be used to save lives, but the day when the guild changes that hundreds of years old policy will likely never come.
