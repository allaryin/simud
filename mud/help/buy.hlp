GENERAL HELP
BUY
This is probably the most intuitive shop function, I don't know why I am
writing a help file for it, but in the sake of completeness... In a shop,
you can ~CCOMbuy~CHLP things.

 ~CDEF> ~CCOMbuy 3 plum wood
 The shopkeeper says to you~CDEF: Three plum wood cost 3 coins.
 ~CACTYou hand over the coins in exchange for three plum wood.

~CHLPFairly self explanatory, ne?

~CLABSee also: ~CREFlist, sell, currency
