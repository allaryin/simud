PLAYER HELP
UPTIME
The uptime command displays how long the game (Walraven) and server (Hedwig)
have been running, how much RAM is used (Memory and Swap), some statistics about
how hard the server is working (Load), and the time to next world save. This
information is generally not of much interest to players.
