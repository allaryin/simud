READINESS
Many actions, including things like walking around, have a limit on how
fast you can do them. How much you can do is dependent on your
~CBRTreadiness meter~CHLP. To see your readiness meter,
type ~CCOMready~CHLP to display it. You can also view it every
time the value changes with the ~CCOMautoready~CHLP command (very spammy).
