PLAYER HELP
SAVE
Using the ~CCOMsave~CHLP command saves your character on the Walraven server, but as this is done automatically when you log off or lose link this command is of little use.

The only benefit from using this command is in case there is a server crash, so it is not very important unless you are overly paranoid. See ~CREFuptime~CHLP, reboots are few and far-between.
