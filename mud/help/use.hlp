PLAYER HELP
USE
The ~CCOMuse~CHLP command is how you interact with an object that has no
other obvious means of activation. You use fields in order to start farming
on them, you use wands to shoot them at people, you use the exercise machine
to work off excess pounds, etc...

When an object has a special power and you can't figure out how to make it
happen, try using it.
