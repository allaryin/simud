PLAYER HELP
AUTOBREAK
Some MUD clients inflict this kind of problem on you:

[Walraven] Bob says: Hi!

If you want it to split the lines apart when new text comes in, like this:

[Walraven]

Bob says: Hi!

Then you should turn on autobreak. The command is ~CCOMtoggle autobreak~CHLP.
Rocket science this isn't.
