PLAYER HELP
ICON
Your icon on the map is a white ~[150@~CHLP, other players are a blue ~[040@~CHLP until you are introduced to them, then you see the first letter of their names. For other icons, see the ~CREFmap~CHLP helpfile.

Wizards, the ICON() macro is used to paint icons. It's defined in /include/const.h and almost everything in /items or /monsters has an example.
