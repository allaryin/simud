MUD HELP
IDEA
The idea command is like the MUD's suggestion box. Ideas are logged, and
will be looked at by the wizards. The command is very easy to use: just type
~CCOMidea <description>~CHLP where <description> is your idea. Ideas will be
implemented depending on our free time and the quality of the idea.
