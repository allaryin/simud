PLAYER HELP
CHAIN
This command lets you chain up to 10 commands together, and do them all in
a row. This is probably most helpful for aliases. The commands should have
// between them, such as ~CCOMchain bow bob//say bob: hello~CHLP. Many
commands take some time to execute; if you have a long chain of commands
going, and you need to cut things short, you should look at the
~CCOMstop~CHLP command.
