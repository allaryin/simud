BOARD
A board is a piece of wood. Often, you use these things to build houses and
such. You acquire boards by chopping down trees and then crafting boards out
of the resultant logs.

Board is also a verb. It generally applies to moving something onto a
vehicle of some sort or another. When you are waiting at a dock and a boat
arrives, you can ~CCOMboard~CHLP it in order to travel to the next island ;)
