MAGIC HELP
DARK MANA
Also known as the void or plane of shadows, the dark plane is thought to be the origin of anger and all negative emotion. It is incredibly cold and the spirits that live there tend to be of the nastiest sort. It is largely for this reason that necromancy has been forbidden. It is thought that the spirits of the evil dead inhabit the plane of darkness. The mana itself is a charcoal black in color and is only really useful for making direct assaults on the spirits of other living beings or when creating vacuum type effects.
