PLAYER HELP
SIT
~CCOMSit~CHLPs down, if you aren't already. You can't move around if you're
sitting down, and you will be in bigger trouble if someone attacks you, but
sitting people get hungry slower and heal faster.

You can sit by things: ~CCOMsit by nearest tree~CHLP, and you can sit on
things: ~CCOMsit on chair~CHLP.
