GENERAL HELP
KEEPING ITEMS
In general, there are certain items that you will always want to cary with
you. In order to prevent yourself from accidentally dropping or giving
something away, it is possible to ~CCOMkeep~CHLP it. If you want to get rid
of something that you are keeping, you can ~CCOMunkeep~CHLP the item.

~CWRNKeeping items has been broken for a while since somebody played with
the drop and give commands. This is a known bug that needs to be fixed.
