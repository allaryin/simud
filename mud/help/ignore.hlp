COMMANDS
IGNORE
The format for this command is ~CCOMignore <player>~CHLP. If someone is
persistently sending you annoying or obnoxious tells, you should use
this command to silence them. You will not hear any further tells
from that player. To stop ignoring someone, just type ~CCOMignore <player>
~CHLP again. If you type ~CCOMignore~CHLP by itself, it will show you
a list of everyone you are currently ignoring.
