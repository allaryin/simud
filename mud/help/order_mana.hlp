MAGIC HELP
ORDER MANA
The plane of order is the only plane in addition to those of earth and ice that contains a high amount of solid physical matter. Most of this material is in the form of heavy metals and gemstones, all of which appear in very regular geometric patterns. The mana itself is a dark brown, like that of mahogany wood without the grain. Order magic is incredibly difficult to use, and as a result, very few spells have been developed to harness it. Because it is so incredibly resistant to change, order mana makes a lousy bonding agent - hence the use of water in stead to control large spells. When it does turn out to be useful, order magic has effects of gravity and attraction as well as thost that are nice in creating wards and protections.
