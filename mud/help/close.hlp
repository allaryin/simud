PLAYER COMMANDS
OPEN/CLOSE
Doors are present on most buildings in the game, and can be either open, closed, or locked. If the door is open, a player can walk right through it. If closed, the door must be opened before a player can travel through. Finally, if the door is locked, it must be unlocked before it can be opened to go through.

To open a door, the format is ~CCOMopen door~CHLP. To shut it, ~CCOMclose door~CHLP. 

Some other objects can also be opened and closed, in those cases the syntax is ~CCOMopen <object>~CHLP/~CCOMclose <object>~CHLP.

~CLABSee also: ~CREFlock~CHLP, ~CREFunlock~CHLP
