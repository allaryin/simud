WIZARD HELP
SETAC (SET ARMOR CLASS)
Takes three parameters -- a player or creature (who must be present when you
use the command), an AC type, and a value. The AC types are listed in
/include/battle.h. If you give 'all' as the AC type, it sets all the values
at once. You may use the score command to view your AC values, although I'm
not aware of a command to view another object's AC.
