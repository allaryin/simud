WIZARD HELP
FLASH
Updates your player object, but saves you the trouble of having to log in
and out. You should always test that the player object is at least compiling
(with the ~CCOMload ~CHLPcommand) before attempting to flash yourself using untested
code. (In future, flash might take a player name as a parameter.)
