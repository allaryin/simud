GRANDTOTAL
The grandtotal command is used to help you count how widespread certain
resources or items are becoming. It's similar in idea to the whereis
command, except that in addition to counting the number of objects,
it also counts their quantities. It can also differentiate between
objects in the world and objects in inventories.

Usage is simple: ~CCOMgrandtotal filename~CHLP. For a quick example,
try ~CCOMgrandtotal /obj/coins~CHLP.
