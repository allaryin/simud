EDIT (EDIT FILE -- FULL SCREEN)
This verb invokes our experimental full screen file editor. If you get stuck
in it, remember you can always exit by pushing escape three times. It takes
a file name as a parameter, and you must run keysetup before you can use it.
It is still under development, so this documentation is not complete.
