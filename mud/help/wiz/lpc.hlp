WIZARD HELP
LPC
Executes any snippet of LPC code. You may use any efun or sefun in your
code. This works by creating a temporary object, ~/call_exec. You may use
find_thing in your LPC code. The other #defines and whatnot you can use are in ~CCOM/obj/wizard.c~CHLP. Here is an example:

~CCOMlpc msg("Hello "+this_player()->query_specific()+"!");
