ITREE
This command shows you the inheritance tree for an object (~CCOMitree waterskin~CHLP)  or source file (~CCOMitree /obj/player.c~CHLP). For player.c, you'll see at the first level inendation all the files that player.c directly inherits from, then under each of those what files (if any) they inherit from.
