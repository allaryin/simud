WIZARD COMMANDS
SKILLS
The wizard view of skills is somewhat more informative than that for players. Typing ~CCOMskills~CHLP as a wizard will give you the following information: spell name as registered in the magic daemon, bonus (based on relevant stats), skill level, total experience, current experience pending over the maximum experience before the next level, and the string description of the skill level.

Wizards can also view the skills of other players by typing ~CCOMskills <player>~CHLP. To see skills as a player would see them, type ~CCOMskills -<player>~CHLP, where ~CCOM<player>~CHLP may be omitted to view your own skills without the extra wizard-only information.
