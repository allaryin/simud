ORPHANS
An orphaned object is one whose blueprint is destructed. This generally
means its code is out of date. The MUD gradually processes all known orphan
objects, updating them to the current blueprint code using a process similar
to ~CCOMupdate~CHLP's.

Typing ~CCOMorphans~CHLP tells you which blueprints have orphans, and how
many. Giving an object name as parameter will list all orphans of that
type.
