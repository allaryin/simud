WIZARD HELP
RIGHTS
Takes a path (which may include wildcards * or ?) as a parameter. If no parameter is given, the current
directory is assumed. Gives the file access rules for the directory
specified, and a list of all files in that directory (or the files which the
wildcard specifies). Some files are
highlighted, and the name of their owner (a UID) is given. All files that are not
highlighted are owned by the directory owner.
