WIZARD COMMANDS
WHEREIS
Takes an object reference as a parameter. The reference will either be a player name, a living name, or an object name (file#nnn). This will trace out from wherever the object is and give you a complete path, anchored from the world object. This is very useful for finding where a player is or where clones of an item are, although you might find other uses for it.

If you type ~CCOMwhereis all~CHLP, you will get a complete list of the locations of all the players currently logged in. There is also one switch for whereis, ~CCOM-f~CHLP, which will show only objects in invalid locations.
