SETSTAT
Takes two parameters.  The first parameter is the stat and the second is
the value.  Sets the passed in stat to the passed in value.  Any of the
basic stats may be edited to any value between 1 and 20.  You may use the 
score command to view your current stats and for a listing of all the 
different stats that you have to set.
