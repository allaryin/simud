WIZARD COMMANDS
HEAD
This utility command displays the first few lines of a file or group of files. You may include wildcards in the file name, such as ~CLAB./*.c~CHLP. (Note that ~CLAB~TILD/~CHLP does not work at this time.)

The simplest usage is just ~CCOMhead <file>~CHLP; this will display several lines of <file>. The number of lines displayed defaults to two-thirds your terminal height. You can display fewer (but not more) lines of code with the -n switch. Type ~CCOMhead -n <#> <file>~CHLP, where # is the number of lines from each file to display.

Normally, head will display the file verbatim, including any tilde codes within the file. If you want tilde codes processed, include the -p switch: ~CCOMhead -p <files>~CHLP. You may combine this with the -n switch, but the -p must be first: ~CCOMhead -p -n 3 <files>~CHLP but ~CWRNnot~CHLP ~CCOMhead -n 3 -p <files>~CHLP.

See: ~CREFmore~CHLP, ~CREFtail~CHLP, ~CREFtermsize~CHLP
