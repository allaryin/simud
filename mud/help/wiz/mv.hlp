WIZARD HELP
MV (MOVE FILE)
The first parameter is a source file, the second a destination file. Moves
the file from one place to another in the directory tree. Currently does not
handle wildcards.

This is also the command for renaming files. To use it for that, type
~CCOMmv oldname newname~CHLP.

See also: ~CREFrm, cp, cd
