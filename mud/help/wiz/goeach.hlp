WIZARD COMMANDS
GOEACH
This command allows you to iterate through a list of objects given by a previous listing verb. The syntax is very simple: ~CCOMgoeach~CHLP will teleport you to the next item in the list and remove that object from the list.

For example, typing the command ~CCOMwhereis /monsters/rabbit.c~CHLP will list all the rabbits in the world. Additionally, it saves the list of objects it returns as a descriptions -- and therefore mostly invisible -- object in your inventory. So long as you do not use another list-producing verb (or log out), you can use ~CCOMgoeach~CHLP at any time to teleport to the next item the listing verb reported.

Once the last object in the list has been visited, the list object will be removed from your inventory.
