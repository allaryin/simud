WIZARD HELP
FORCE
Forces a player to do something. It takes the command you want the player to
do as a parameter. Don't abuse this command! It is impossible to force
someone on a higher level than you to do something. Here is an example:

~CCOMforce bob 'My, what a buffoon I am!~CHLP -- A stupid prank on Bob.
