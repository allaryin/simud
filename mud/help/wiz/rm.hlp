WIZARD HELP
RM (REMOVE FILE)
Takes a file as a parameter and deletes it. Removed files may be salvaged,
although as of this writing the command for salvaging them is not yet
written. You may only remove files to which you have modify access. If you find you deleted something you didn't mean to, you need to let an admin know post-haste so they can get it back for you.
