WIZARD HELP
RMGROUP (REMOVE GROUP)
Takes a UID and a group as a parameter. If the UID given currently has
access to that group, and if you are allowed to control access for that
group, then the UID loses its access. Otherwise, this command does nothing.
This command is used to reverse the effects of ~CCOMaddgroup~CHLP.
