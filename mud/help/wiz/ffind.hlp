WIZARD COMMANDS
FFIND
If you are searching for where a function is implemented when dealing with inheritance, use ~CCOMffind <file> <function>~CHLP. <file> may end with ".c" and <function> with "()", or not, as you prefer. The command will either return the name of the file that implements the function inherited by <file> or else report that the function is not defined for <file>.
