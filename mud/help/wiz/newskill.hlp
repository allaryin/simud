WIZARD HELP
NEWSKILL
Gives a player a new skill, and sets that skill to level 1 (the lowest
value possible for a skill that is actually had). Once a skill is added,
chances are, it will never be removed, so pay attention when fiddling with
this.

Takes a player and a complete skill name as parameters.

Example:
 ~CDEF> ~CCOMnewskill lars other.firstaid
 ~CDEFLars was given the other.firstaid skill.

~CLABSee also: ~CREFsetac, setwc, setskill, skills
