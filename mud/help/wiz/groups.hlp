WIZARD HELP
GROUPS
Takes a UID as a parameter. Gives a list of the groups which that UID is
able to access. Any files or directories with those UID's may be accessed as
if you own them. You may grant others access to your main UID (wizards) or
any UID you own (archwizards) with ~CCOMaddgroup~CHLP, and you may undo that
access with ~CCOMrmgroup.~CHLP
