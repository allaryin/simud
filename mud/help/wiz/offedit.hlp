WIZARD HELP
OFFEDIT
There is an elderly object in the /obj directory, called the
"offline editor." It is the very first editor we made available for the MUD.
You use it by typing ~CCOMclone /obj/offedit~CHLP. Minimal instructions on
using its commands may be found on the web page (type ~CCOMhelp
doxygen~CHLP).
