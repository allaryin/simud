WIZARD HELP
ADDLANDMARK
Allows you to add landmarks to map areas. It looks like this:

~CCOMaddlandmark 20 24 the wizard's tower~CHLP

Note that it doesn't need to be capitalized (unless it's a proper name).
In order to line them up with the rooms, the first number (the x coordinate)
will always be a multiple of 10, and the second number (the y coordinate)
will always be a multiple of 6. The landmark is added to whichever area
you're in, generally.
