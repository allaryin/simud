COMBAT HELP
STANCE
Stance is an attribute used in combat to determine the kinds
of actions you can do. It's easy to change from stance to stance, and
simply adds to the readiness cost of performing an action.

If you are actually interested in the short messages displayed by players
or NPC's in the room description, then you should look up "doing" strings
in the living object in the doxygen.
