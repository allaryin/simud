WIZARD HELP
FINGER
In addition to the normal use of finger for getting information on
individual users, wizards can type ~CCOMfinger~CHLP without any arguments in
order to get detailed connection information on all users, specifically:
 * what ip they are coming from
 * is their connection secured?
 * is their connection compressed?
 * the reverse lookup on their ip
