MKDIR (MAKE DIRECTORY)
This function takes a directory name as a parameter and creates the
directory. If you pass in a complex directory name, it assumes that only the
topmost directory name given doesn't exist; otherwise this function will
fail. Directories default to having the same file access setup as their
parent directories.
