WIZARD HELP
WHERE

The command ~CCOMwhere~CHLP shows where a verb is implemented.  If the verb can be found in your bin path, then the verb's absolute location is returned.  If the verb was provided by an add_action, then a reference to the object supplying the action is returned.

For example, ~CCOMwhere help~CHLP returns ~CBRT/bin/help.c~CHLP, while ~CCOMwhere alias~CHLP returns ~CBRT/obj/player#<your ref number>~CHLP.
