WIZARD HELP
ECHO
This is similar to the say or emote commands; the only difference is that
your name is not attached to the output in anyway. Everyone in the room
receives the text you type exactly as you typed it. By default, the text is
~CBRTthis color~CHLP. Unlike say or emote, you may use tilde codes in your
echoed string to change colors or do special effects.
