WIZARD COMMANDS
TRANSPORT
Typing ~CCOMtrans <object>~CHLP transports the target to your environment. This only works for living objects, but is a lot friendlier than moving them, because it tells them that they have been moved, and it moves them next to you (so they won't end up across the room or similar).

See: ~CREFmove~CHLP
