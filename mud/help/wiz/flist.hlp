FLIST (FUNCTION LIST)
Given an object reference, displays a list of all the functions in
that object. This is useful for figuring out the exact name of a set
or query function that you want to use. Try:

~CCOMflist me~CHLP

to spam yourself to death (player objects have a huge number of functions).

See also: ~CREFreference, call, query
