WIZARD HELP
ED (EDIT FILE)
Takes a file-name as a parameter. This command gives you access to the
driver's line editor, ed. This much maligned editor is still fairly useful
for some type of editing. If you wish to learn more about it, look at the
documention in /doc/lpc/ed*.

If for any reason the ed verb breaks, there is a copy of it in
~CCOMedback~CHLP. It does the exact same thing as ed.
