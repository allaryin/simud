WIZARD HELP
RMWIZARD (REMOVE WIZARD)
Administrators only. Removes a wizard's name from the wizard list. Use this
if a wizard resigns or is kicked out of the MUD. It is a good idea to either
drop their player file to a lower level, or to delete it (look in /players).
This command reverses the effects of addwizard.
