Takes a file as a parameter. Dumps the file to the screen, pausing after
each screenful of text (push enter to get the next screenful), or lets you view it line
by line (push space, then enter to get just one more line). You may scroll through the file
using 'u' and 'd' to jump forward and back pages. Exit more by typing 'q'.
