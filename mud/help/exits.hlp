EXITS
Exits are how you travel between the different rooms that make up a mud. They are usually indicated by one of the various cardinal directions (north, south, east, west), but can also be defined by any number of different words (enter, leave, out, exit, up, portal, etc...).

Exits are not guaranteed to be immediately visible upon entering a room, and are not even guaranteed to be passable. A trap door might be hidden under a rug, and a trail might be covered by bushes or blocked by rubble, etc... When you see something suspicious, you might want to give it a closer look with the ~CCOMlook~CHLP command.

The list of readily visible exits is given in the room description when you ~CCOMlook~CHLP. Exits are also indicated on the room map by lines of periods.
