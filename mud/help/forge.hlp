CRAFTING HELP
FORGE
forge - n - A furnace where metals are heated and wrought (smithed).
      - v - To use a forge.
          - To manufacture falsified documents.

Forges in this game will eventually be required in order to craft and repair
metal items.

Forging in the sense of counterfit money will eventually also be
implemented, but don't expect it any time this decade.
