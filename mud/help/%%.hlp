WIZARD COMMANDS
%%
Typing ~CCOM%%~CHLP by itself will execute your last command. ~CCOM%%list~CHLP displays your command history, where the numbers begin with your last command as 1. Appending a number (e.g., ~CCOM%%3~CHLP) will execute that entry in the command history list. (~CCOM%%1~CHLP is therefore synonymous with ~CCOM%%~CHLP.)
