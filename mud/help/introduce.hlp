PLAYER HELP
INTRODUCE
This command is used when you meet someone new and you wish to tell them
your name. Simply type ~CCOMintroduce to name~CHLP and from then on they will
see your name instead of your short description. If you don't yet know their
name, you can ~CCOMintroduce to all~CHLP or ~CCOMintroduce to human~CHLP (as
appropriate.)
