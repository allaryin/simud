PLAYER HELP
PUT
This command will allow a player to put an item into a place. 
This can be done by '~CCOMput item in place~[060'. (i.e. ~CCOMput sword in forge~[060)

You can only put items into a place that you are standing next to. If you are not close enough to the place, you will automatically walk to it. 

~CCOMSee also: ~CREFget~[060
