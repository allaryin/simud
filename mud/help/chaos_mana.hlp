MAGIC HELP
CHAOS MANA
There is not much to say about the plane of chaos other than that its mana is rarely useful for peaceful purposes, and then, only for reasons of frivolity or entertainment. Just as binding water mana into a spell has a controlling effect on the result, binding chaos mana into a spell tends to have the opposite effect. The plane is completely unexplored, and the guild sees no point in even trying, as its layout is in a constant state of flux. The spirits are very difficult to control, but incredibly powerful. If pressed to come up with a color to describe this mana, with all of its fluxuations, the experts on this sort of thing tend to agree on the word 'orange' but little else.
