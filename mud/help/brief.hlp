PLAYER HELP
BRIEF
Using this command toggles brief mode on and off. When in brief mode, you will only see short descriptions of rooms while you move about. 

While in brief mode, you can use the ~CCOMlook~CHLP command to get the full description of the room. The default for a new player is off, or verbose mode.
