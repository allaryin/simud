PLAYER HELP
FLEE
Panic and run for an exit! This only works during fights, and is currently
the only nonmagical way of running from a fight. You may specify a direction
if you want:
 ~CDEF> flee east
 ~CACTYou panic and begin to look for an exit!
 You flee east.

~CHLPIf you do not specify a direction, you will run randomly. This is what
happens when your wimpy goes off, so it is usually smarter to try to flee
manually before letting your wimpy take over.
