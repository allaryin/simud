WIZARD HELP
INSTANT MESSAGES
Instant messages are sent by typing ~CCOMmail~CHLP then using the
~CCOMim <name>~CHLP command, where <name> is the person you wish to receive
the message. An instant message is a bit like a 'tell' command, except that
if the person is not logged in, they will receive the message next time they
log in.

Alternately, you can just type ~CCOM im <name>~CHLP in the game without entering the mail interface.
