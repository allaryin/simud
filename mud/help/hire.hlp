PLAYER HELP
HIRE
The ~CCOMhire~CHLP command allows you to take ownership of an unaligned
peasant. At present, hiring peasants doesn't cost anything, but that will
probably change when more specialized npc's are made available for the
employing.

Once you've hired a peasant, they're yours for as long as you can keep them
alive, or until you ~CCOMrelease~CHLP them from your service.
