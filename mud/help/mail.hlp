GENERAL HELP
MAIL
In general, you can use the ~CCOMmail~CHLP command to send mail to other
players. Typing ~CCOM?~CHLP within the mail system will give a list of
commands that you can use.

Sending mail does not cost you anything and mail is delivered instantly. As
the game progresses, there will likely be a physical postal system
implemented, but that is going to be a long time coming.
