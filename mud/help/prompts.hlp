COMMANDS
PROMPTS
Prompts are customizable. Simply type ~CCOMprompt <string>~CHLP to set your current and default prompts to whatever string you like. You may include color codes, although regular and wizard color codes cannot be mixed in the same prompt.

To remove your prompt altogether, have ~CCOM<string>~CHLP be any of the following, depending on whichever is easiest for you to remember: ~CCOMnone~CHLP, ~CCOMoff~CHLP, ~CCOMclear~CHLP, ~CCOM""~CHLP.

In the future, prompts may take advantage of closures to allow things like hp display, time of day, etc., but at the moment they do not.
