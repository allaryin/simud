MAGIC HELP
EARTH MANA
The physical world. For those with an eye for that sort of thing, earth mana is a very dark bluish green, reminiscent of algae, or perhaps the juice one has left over after boiling artichokes. Earth mana is not only useful when manipulating dirt and stone, but also has its place in manifesting changes in biological creatures and is quite popular with alchemists.
