This directory holds information about your computer's current state. For
the uptime command to print system information, you should set up a cron job
(or your O/S's equivalent) to periodically copy system information to this
directory. The files currently in this directory are just old echoes of what
was here on the original server; information will thus be frozen or
inaccurate unless you either delete those files or set up an update script.
