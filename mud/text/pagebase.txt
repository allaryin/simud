It takes a brilliant mind to start a MUD.

This is one of many myths that has forever lowered the bar for MUDders everywhere.  The truth is, almost any idiot can start a MUD.  The brilliance is only necessary to start a good MUD.

Unfortunately, we at Walraven are finding ourselves in a brilliance deficit.  So we've finally decided to turn to the unspeakable: Recruitment.

If you are brilliant, or even above-average, and have any kind of coding experience, we need you to do nifty little things that, five years ago, you probably never imagined you'd be doing.  We need people to code monster intelligence, evironmental development, and other great stuff that can help make Walraven really perky.

The administration of Walraven does not consist of tyrants.  We are not intelligent enough to rule our domain with an iron fist.  We think of it as more of a palm of clay.  We are still very young in our developmental stages, and open to new ideas.  Expressive wizards are welcomed.
