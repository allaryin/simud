All right, here are some of the things bothering me about this whole
overworld thing ...

1. I really, actually, want a flat overworld. Dividing it into areas is,
well, icky.

2. Ok, so say I do a flat overworld. I can solve the grid problem,
it's not particularly relevant. Where do I put the blasted room objects?
Problem: LPC uses linked lists to store inventories of an object;
if I put 20,000 rooms into one object, then the search times are going
to increase linearly. That's completely unacceptable.
Problem: Addressing rooms requires a major overhaul

3. All right, say that we use the existing code, very little new
stuff. That's ideal, right? We just have many larger areas
with the overworld areas in them. Maybe some kind of octree-like hierarchy.
Problem: Adjacency is really icky when dealing with a
grid segmented between multiple objects. *Really* bad.
Problem: Addressing rooms is icky, though it can use existing code more.

4. All right, what if we store the overworld map in a world-sized grid (#2),
but put the rooms in hierarchical objects (#3)?
Problem: Map editor is going to choke badly on this.
Problem: Map *painting* isn't going to be too happy.
