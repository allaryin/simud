News:

~CBRT04/11/04~CDEF  Scrolls work again. Mostly. I'll probably be hacking them a
          bit more in the near future, but will not actually disable them
          ever again, eh? -- ~[060Al~CDEF

~CBRT04/16/04~CDEF  Two new spells have been added to the game: ~CREFaid~CDEF and ~CREFinvigorate~CDEF.
          They must be ~CCOMmemorize~CDEFd from scrolls if you want to learn them (ask
          me for one if nobody else can help).
              It is now also possible to ~CCOMmeditate~CDEF in order to speed one's
          mana regeneration. -- ~[060Al~CDEF

~CBRT04/22/04~CDEF  I've totally redone the internals of how the world saves itself.
          Hopefully the new method will be faster and more reliable. If you
          see corruption bugs or similar problems, tell me quickly! The sooner
          bugs are caught, the less damage is done. -- ~[090Acius~CDEF
