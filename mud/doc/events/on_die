void on_die()

Called when this_object() dies. This obviously only applies to living
objects; inaniminate objects cannot die (this rule might loosen for
destroyable things, we'll see). The death has already occurred when this
happens (note that dying does not destroy the thing that died; it simply
changes its state to being a 'corpse').
