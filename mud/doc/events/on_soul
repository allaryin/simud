FOR SCRIPTS: on_soul

Called whenever a soul command occurs. Actor is the one performing the 
soul, Target is the target of the soul (if any), Text is the full text of 
the soul message, and Type is an integer giving the soul type. Available 
soul types are listed as flags in /include/emote.h. Not all souls are 
flagged with types, so the type is often zero, but when it is flagged, you 
can assume it is accurate.
