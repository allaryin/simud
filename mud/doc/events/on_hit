void on_hit( object attacker, int amount )

Called whenever a monster gets struck by any kind of attack. Only called if
the attacker is apparently living -- damage that is a direct result of
something you do to yourself is not reported this way. The 'amount' is how
many hit points were lost in the attack.

Be aware the blow may have been fatal.

FOR SCRIPTS: on_hit

Called when YOU get hit. Actor is the one hurting you, and Amount is the 
amount of damage that was done (in HP).
