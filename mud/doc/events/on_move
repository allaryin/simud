void on_move(object src)

Called whenever this_object() is moved. src is the object from which it
was moved, and is either an object pointer or null (the integer 0). If
it's null, then this is the first time the object has been moved after
creation. The movement has already happened when this function is called.
It is called before on_insert, but after on_remove.
