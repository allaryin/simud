int on_use( object target )

This is called when your object is used with the "use" command. The
this_player() will be whoever is doing the using. The target may be
0, in which case the object was used without a target. If you return 0,
then a generic error message will be printed. If you print your own
message, or if the use succeeds, you should return 1.
