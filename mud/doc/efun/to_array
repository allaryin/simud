SYNOPSIS
        mixed *to_array(string)
        mixed *to_array(symbol)
        mixed *to_array(quotedarray)
        mixed *to_array(mixed *)

        (int*)<value>

DESCRIPTION
        Strings and symbols are converted to an int array that
        consists of the args characters.

        Quoted arrays are ``dequoted'', and arrays are left as they
        are.

        structs are converted into a normal array.

HISTORY
        LDMud 3.3.250 added structs to the accepted data types.
