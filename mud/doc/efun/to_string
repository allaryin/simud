SYNOPSIS
        string to_string(mixed)

        (string)<value>

DESCRIPTION
        The argument is converted to a string. Works with int, float,
        object, arrays, structs, symbols, strings, and closures.

        Converts closures and structs into an appropriate name (this
        has mostly debugging purposes).

        CAVEAT: Arrays are considered exploded strings, ie. arrays of char
        codes, and are 'imploded' up to the first non-number entry, whatever
        comes first. That means that to_string( ({ 33, 34 }) ) will return
        "12" and not "({ 33, 34 })".

HISTORY

        LDMud 3.3.250 adds structs to the accepted data types.
