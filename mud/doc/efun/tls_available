PRELIMINARY
SYNOPSIS
        int tls_available()

DESCRIPTION
        If the global TLS initialisation could not been set up, 
        tls_is_available() returns 0, otherwise 1.
        It is not very useful calling any other tls_*-efun if this one 
        returns 0, since there is no TLS-encryption available.
        Most likely the global initialisation fails due to missing or 
        unreadable key resp. certificate-file.
