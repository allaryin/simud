PRELIMINARY
SYNOPSIS
        int tls_init_connection(object ob)
        int tls_init_connection(object ob, string fun, string|object fob, mixed extra...)
        int tls_init_connection(object ob, closure fun, mixed extra...)

DESCRIPTION
        tls_init_connection() tries to start a TLS secured connection to 
        the interactive object <ob> (or this_object() if <ob> is not given).

        Result:
          errorcode < 0: unsuccessful, use tls_error() to get an useful
                         description of the error
             number > 0: the secure connection is still being set up in the
                          background
            number == 0: the secure connection is active.
        
        If the callback <fun>/<fun>:<fob> is specified, it will be called
        once the fate of the secure connection has been determined. The
        first argument will be the return code from the handshake
        (errorcode < 0 on failure, or 0 on success), followed by the
        interactive object <ob> and any <extra> arguments.
