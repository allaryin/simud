       A helper object for the keysetup verb.

       Call the setup function in this object to start an interface. It should
       be cloned and moved inside the user's player object before being
       invoked (there is a slight risk of conflict if two players attempt to
       use it at once from the master copy).

       From the help: Different MUD and telnet clients use a wide variety of
       special codes to represent different keys on your keyboard. When using
       certain parts of the MUD, like the full screen text editor, the MUD
       needs to know what these codes are. The MUD will understand a lot of
       the standard codes, but your client may have some special codes we
       don't know about. This object lets you type in those codes, so that
       your keyboard settings will work properly.
