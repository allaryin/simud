       Scenery is an alternate use of the description/item combination (as it
       appears in trinkets). Unlike a trinket, scenery should provide a
       'phrase' in the short description. This phrase, which is always a
       complete sentence, is tacked on immediately to the end of the long
       description and will not show up on the 'You see' list. It should have
       no extra spaces on the beginning or end, and it is polite to drop the
       color back to light gray at the end of the phrase if you use color
       changes.

       The main purpose of scenery is to allow for player level flexibility in
       the fine art of interior design. Scenery could be inherited and
       modified to make it destroyable. I also intend to make scenery in which
       you can hide objects, secrete yourself, etc.
