       This file defines combat forms. These are where your default actions in
       combat come from.

       Documentation here is thus far abysmal, and will hopefully improve.

       This function gets called from the living object if action is being
       considered, but no action is on the queue. The job of this function is,
       if desired, to push an action onto the action queue. If no action is
       pushed, that's ok too, but you'll sit around like an idiot while
       getting pounded.

       A caveat: This function is only called when readiness reaches 1000. It
       is possible for some actions to have a lower readiness requirement than
       this, but living doesn't know whether you are going to choose one of
       those, so it waits until 1000 (the maximum readiness requirement) is
       reached before having the form select an action. This (usually)
       guarantees that the action triggers immediately, which helps avoid
       certain noxious sorts of confusion.
