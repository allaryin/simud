       The SSaavveellooaadd system, at boot time, keeps track of objects whose data
       files were not loaded. Their numbered data files are then freed up for
       use by other objects. This causes a problem with player inventories --
       since a player's inventory is not typically present at boot time, their
       data files get lost or overwritten.

       For this reason I came up with the inventory bubble system. The gist of
       this is that, even though the player no longer exists on the MUD, their
       inventory does. It will be kept in one of these bubbles.

       Some inventory items will probably have heartbeats or similar. It is
       recommended that these items be written to include a state of suspended
       animation.
