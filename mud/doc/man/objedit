       Acius's Nifty OObbjjeecctt Editor.

       There's a couple things you can do with this object editor: You can
       make a template, or edit an existing one, or edit an existing object.

       If you give a valid object name for a .c file, It will clone that file
       and allow you to edit the variables. This will save a template. It
       allows you to save back to the original source file as well, but only
       if there is OBJEDIT delimiting in the ccrreeaattee(()) function (It does not
       mess up any custom code in the file).

       If you give a valid object name for a .o file, and the .o file contains
       a my_file_name field, then it will clone the relevant file, load the .o
       file, and allow you to edit it that way.

       If you give a valid object reference for an already existing object, it
       will simply point to that object and allow you to edit it.

       To use this object editor, clone it and move it inside the wizard who
       will use it. Then call the obj_edit(str) function, where str is the
       string referring to either an object file or actual object.

       Note: Needs updating!
