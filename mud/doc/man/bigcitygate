       This actually causes the player to pass through the exit. _m is the
       mapping with the exit information; if you want information about the
       player or the room, use this_player() and environment(this_player())
       respectively. An error message is printed if the exit fails.

       A fair amount of error checking has already been done on _m, so the core
       information is most likely valid.

       Just returns a point, offset by the position of the door. Moves with
       its parent building, if it has one.

       Draw the exit. If you are writing your own exit type, you should
       override this function

       Erk, conflict between desc & twoway here! This is ugly.
