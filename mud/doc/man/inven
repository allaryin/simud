       Inheritable object which makes their inheritor capable of saving its
       inventory.

       This is the inventory inheritance. Inherit this object if you want this
       object to remember all the objects that are inside of it, and to
       restore them whenever it is created/save them when it is destroyed.
       This assumes that your object's environment is also using the
       save_self/load_self rules.

       (A note: Only objects which cannot have things inserted into them
       should not inherit this file. The world is an inventory based object,
       except that it loads itself.)

       Restore the object specified by str. To restore all the objects, use a
       call_each. This also moves the object inside of this_object()
