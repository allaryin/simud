       A largely obsolete object, but it is still used in some places. This
       was designed to overcome LPC's ancient problem of not handling arrays
       -- if that gives you an idea of how old this code is. It allows you to
       handle a \n delimited string as if it were a list. With newer versions
       of the driver, and ever improving array management, this has become far
       less critical (this was written first in '96?), but it still finds its
       uses (the object editor still uses this method for getting variable
       lists, for example).
