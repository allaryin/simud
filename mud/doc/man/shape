       This object has functions for doing simple calculations on shapes and
       storing the shape of this object. Note that if the shape is an
       important piece of data (i.e. it has to save when the mud reboots, and
       it can't be recalculated from other data), then you should look at the
       Spots component.

           This object's shape. If you don't specify a shape, the shape will
           be guessed by painting the object in a special mode. It's a little
           slow, but functional if that is all you want.
