       This will be the base object for all guild objects. As guilds develop
       further, this object will also be developed.

       When a player or monster does not yet have a guild, functions normally
       filled by a personal guild object will be relegated to the master guild
       object, '/obj/guild'. Therefore, code added to this file should not
       assume that this object is in the inventory of this_player(). Derived
       guild objects, however, are welcome to make this assumption.

       Informs a player/living creature of an event that has occurred. This is
       done by calling the function _m_e_s_s_a_g_e___t_y_p_e in the player/living's guild
       object passing it _m_e_s_s_a_g_e___d_a_t_a and _d_e_s_t.

       Functions called should either print their message directly to _d_e_s_t and
       return 0. If they do this, then they must pay attention to the dest
       parameter. Alternatively, they may simply return the string to be
       printed to the living object. In this case, this function will worry
       about routing it correctly.

              The function in the guild object that will be called.

              (Optional) A mixed type variable with data concerning the
              message in it.

       _d_e_s_t   (Optional) A pointer to the object receiving the message. If not
              specified, this_player() is assumed.
