       Class BBoonnuuss
            We still need to provide a mechanism so that an object can decide
           under what conditions bonuses are conferred; for weapons, the
           bonuses should only be conferred if the weapon is wielded. For
           magic items, etc. they may be conferred always. This file will need
           a rewrite after we have completely decided what all our bonuses
           will be.


       Member sshhoowwrreeaaddyy(int val)
            This function doesn't do anything.


       Member llooaadd__sseellff(int id)
            Change from a call_out implementation to an immediate one.


       Member qquueerryy__eennvv__vvaarrss()
            Scrap the 'hair' patch here once inactive player deletion is in
           place.

       Class LLoocckkaabbllee
            Must document this. Later.


       Member ppaaiinntt__mmaapp(string name)
            Take multi-level rooms into account.

       arg4)
            Finish this function to make it work completely.


       Member nneeww__ppaasssswwoorrdd(string f)
            This code uses input_to, one of the last pieces of code on the MUD
           that does so unnecessarily. It could be profitably rewritten to use
           an interface.


       Member ssaavvee__sseellff()
            When inventory saving is no longer implemented by a call_out (in
           saveload.c), this function no longer needs to use deep_inventory to
           save the player's inventory.


       Member aaffkk
            Implement afk commands and add set_afk, query_afk to the player.


       Class RRoooomm
            Write this summary.


       Member aass__llppcc(mixed var, int simple)
           This function will currently recurse forever if passed a recursive
           array or mapping (a fool thing to do in any case). I'd rather it
           did something intelligent, such as fill in recursing arrays or
           mappings with '<RECURSE>' or something.


       Member ssttrriinngg__eeddiitt(string func, string data)
            Not implemented yet.
