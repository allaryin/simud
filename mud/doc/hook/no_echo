SYNOPSIS
        #include <sys/driver_hooks.h>

        set_driver_hook(H_TELNET_NEG, value)

        <value> being:

          void <name>(int flag, object user)
          void <closure>(int flag, object user)

DESCRIPTION
        Optional hook to specifiy how to perform the telnet actions to
        switch the echo mode (used for e.g. password input_to()s).
        Hook setting may be any closure or a string.  If not set, a
        default handling is performed.

        If the setting is a string, it used as name of an lfun to call
        in the interactive <user>, where <flag> is the echo-flag
        passed to the input_to() statement.

        If the setting is a closure, it is called with the same
        arguments, and unbound lambda-closures being bound to
        this_player() prior to execution.

        When set, the hook is called whenever the driver needs to
        change the echo mode, thus you can negotiate about things that
        are coupled with it, like LINEMODE or character-at-a-time.
        
        IMPORTANT: If this hook is used, the control of all telnet
        negotiation is transferred to the mudlib (you must combine it
        with H_TELNET_NEG to conform to the telnet protocol).
