This page was grabbed from a forum post. It could use some editing:

The home and end keys (for start/end of line) do work in the editor. If they
are not working for you, then either your terminal does not send these
control keys (some don't, sigh), or I don't have your terminal's key codes
configured. Run 'keytest' and give me the log when you push those keys. Note
that Ctrl+A and Ctrl+E are also start and end of line, respectively. Most
terminals do not differentiate shift+arrow and the plain arrow, so that's
tricky to read. 

You can go to a line with F1+g+line number+enter, or if you don't have a
working F1, use Ctrl+B instead.
