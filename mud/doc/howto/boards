This howto only applies to boards that use the phpBB database.
Before starting, you should make sure that the object /secure/sql/phpbb is
loading properly, and that you have phpBB installed and running on
your web server (www.phpbb.com as of this writing). You may need to turn
on mySQL support in the driver before phpbb will load.

The first thing you must do is to enter in the account information for the
mySQL database in /secure/sql.c. This information is in two #define'd strings
at the top of sql.c. Simply change the values on these strings to fit the
setup on your database. The account must have access to any database used
by the mud.

With this much going, you should now be able to use the /obj/board object
to view message boards. However, the main use for message boards
in the MUD is for handling bug, nohelp, idea, and similar commands. For
these, you'll need to tell it which forums you want it to post these
reports to.

To figure out which forums you want, use the /obj/board object. You can
query it for information. Here's a typical example:

> query board categories
query_categories() returned:
([ /* #1 */
  "In-Game Boards": 2,
  "Walraven": 1,
  "Flap": 3,
])
> @board set_category In-Game Boards
Call returns:
0
> query board forums
([ /* #1 */
  "Idea": 4,
  "Bug": 3,
  "Help": 6,
  "Typo": 5,
])

... we've now got the information we need -- the numbers next to the name
of each forum are the numbers we need to give to the MUD (you should use
phpBB to create these forums first, obviously). Go to /include/reports.h
and modify the file to have the correct constants.

Your bug, idea, typo, and nohelp logs should now post to the boards as well.
