How to make an accent

Accents modify what you 'say' so that it looks like you are speaking with
an accent. Accents can be set thusly:

set accent=/home/arby/arbees

This would then use the file /home/arby/arbees.c as the accent. The accent
needs to have at least one function:

string garble( string speech )

Whenever something is said, this function will be called. The string
returned is what is actually said.

Accents were invented at 2 in the morning, which explains a great
deal about them.
