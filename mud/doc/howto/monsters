Basically, to make a new monster:

* Use objedit on /obj/monster
  - To learn how to use objedit, read 'help objedit' and type '?' while in
objedit for a list of commands.
* Set up the monster with some default values
* Save the monster to somewhere that you have write access (i.e.
~/mymonster)

Now, to make one of them:

* clone ~/mymonster

For more complex monsters, you will need to modify ~/mymonster.c and
code the behavior that you want.

This is still very rudimentary; it'll work for now, but a more
comprehensive monster creation system is likely up and coming.
