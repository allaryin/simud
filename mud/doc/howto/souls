A dummy howto file on making new soul commands.

Go to /bin/soul. You will need to be granted create or modify access by an
administrator or appropriate archwizard.

The easiest way to make a new soul is to copy and modify an existing
one. This will work:

cp grin.c mynewsoul.c

It uses the file name as the command, so the name does matter. Now, edit
your soul (edit mynewsoul.c, for example) and change it to match
what you want to show as your soul command. The command looks like this:

EMOTE( "~Name ~verbgrin evilly.@@grinning evilly",
"~Name ~verbgrin at ~targ.@@grinning evilly at ~targ" )

This is a macro (see emote.h in /include) which will set up the soul for
you. All you have to do is write the phrases. The first phrase
is the 'untargeted' version of the soul, the second is the
'targeted' version.

The phrases following the @@ are used in the
room description to show what the player is doing, such as 
"You see Bob grinning evilly." It should always be in gerund
(-ing) form. The @@ phrases are optional.

For further reading, try 'help codes' and 'help colors', which will
tell you about those odd ~ codes.
