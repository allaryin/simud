    case 3: return "I wish there were pig-men. You get a few of those pig-men walking around, suddenly I'm looking a lot better. That way if someone wanted to fix me up they could say, 'Hey, at least he's no pig-man.'";

    case 5: return "If you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you.' You should say 'You're so good looking!'";

    case 6: return "The jerk store called, they're running out of you!";

    case 7: return "I'm like a commercial jingle. First it's a little irritating. Then you hear it a few times. You're humming it in the shower. By the third date, it's 'Buy Mennen!'";

    case 8: return "The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it. It's too high. It's in no-man's land. You look like you live with your mother.";

    case 13: return "When women smile at me I don't know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it like they're psychotic or something. And I don't know if I'm supposed to smile back. I don't know what to do.";

    case 14: return "You know, George, they're doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days. I'd be happy to set up a meet and greet.";

    case 15: return "You can do better than me.  You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me.  I'm no good!";

    case 20: return "His whole life revolves around Superman and cereal...";

    case 21: return "You know, Darren, if you had told me twenty-five years ago that some day I'd be standing here about to solve the world's energy problems, I would've said you were crazy. Now let's push this giant ball of oil out this window.";

    case 26: return "Hello, 911?  How are ya?";

    case 27: return "Hey officer!  He's foolin' around back here!";

    case 28: return "Big brokerage houses killed my father.";

    case 29: return "His father was a mudder... His mother was a mudder.";

    case 30: return "Now they show you how detergents take out blood stains, a pretty violent image there. I think if you've got a T-shirt with a bloodstain all over it, maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem. Maybe you should get rid of the body before you do the wash.";

    case 31: return "I don't know if I feel comfortable handing out balogna sandwiches in the building.";

    case 44: return "They're probably creating a whole army of pig-warriors.";

    case 45: return "If I hear an anguished oink, I'm outta here.";

    case 46: return "Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street, I never ever stare at them, and yet I'm careful not to look away, see, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable";

    case 47: return "Horrible, just a horrible thing. Flew right past the children's wing. All the sick children, in the playroom, looking out the window, just traumatized by the incident. Apparently, they all thought he was flying. You know how children are, 'Oh look. A man is flying. A man is flying' And then, splat... ";

    case 48: return "Hey, you know what would make a great coffee table book?  A coffee table book about coffee tables!";

    case 49: return "No, I don't have a square to spare.  I can't spare a square.";

    case 50: return "You ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table?  They feel so special because they've been chosen.  It's enough to make you sick.";

    case 51: return "It's not fair that people are seated first-come, first-serve.  It should be based on who's hungriest.";

    case 52: return "Movie hot dogs?  I'd rather lick the food off the floor.";

    case 53: return "I can't go to a bad movie by myself.  What, am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to strangers?";

    case 54: return "A chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals.  It's a cry for help.  He wants to get caught.";

    case 55: return "Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie. I love the black and white.  Two races of flavor living side by side in harmony. It's a wonderful thing, isn't it?";

    case 56: return "Did you know that the original title for War and Peace was War, What Is It Good For?";

    case 57: return "The sea was angry that day, my friends, like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli.";

    case 58: return "You should've seen her face.  It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.";

    case 59: return "I don't have a good apartment for an intervention.  The furniture, it's very non-confrontational.";

    case 60: return "If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.";

    case 61: return "Hey, believe me, baldness will catch on.  When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to?";

    case 62: return "I love a good nap. Sometimes it's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning.";

    case 63: return "You know they're mentally disturbed. They should be sent to Australia.";

    case 64: return "Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool.";
